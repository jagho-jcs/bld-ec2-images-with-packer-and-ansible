# Build AWS EC2 Machine Images (AMI) With Packer, Terraform and Ansible

This project builds an AMI using `Packer`, `Terraform`, and `Ansible` to install a simple Java Web Application and its dependencies.

If you are running EC2 instances the chances are you will have encountered scenarios where you need to build custom Amazon Machine Images (AMI).

## Packer

Packer is an open source tool used to create machine images for multiple platforms from a single source configuration. It gives you the flexibility to build custom AMI's.

## Terraform

`Terraform` is an open source tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently.

## Ansible

**Ansible** is an open source configuration management tool that can be used during the build process to configure an application and its dependencies.

This process can also be fully automated for integrating into a CI/CD pipeline.
